Project for Adeo Web testing challenge. <br />
Task: API which takes info from LHMT API and displays product recommendations according to upcomming weather. <br /> <br />

This is a basic Symfony project, so launching it is the same as any other symfony project. <br />
Import database if you have one, or create one using doctrine migrations.<br />
Navigate to main project directory (/) and execute command <code>symfony server:start</code> <br />

Total time taken was 1~2 hours, didn't have a lot of time to make everything perfect, so this is closer to MVP than finished product, but it works.
